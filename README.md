# unexpected-react-shallow

A port of the excellent [unexpected-dom](https://github.com/munter/unexpected-dom) to support 
[React](http://reactjs.org) [shallow renderer](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering).

Diffing of props and content, including detailed diffing of object props.

```js

var renderer = TestUtils.createRenderer();

renderer.render(<SomeComponent id={125} />);

expect(renderer, 'to have rendered', 
    <div id={125}>
       Some simple content
    </div>);

```

And you receive a beautiful error message

# Status

Although this project itself is well tested, it is still in early development, and there may well be issues.

Use with caution.  If you find any case that does not work as expected, please report it via the issues.


# Setup

```js

var unexpected = require('unexpected');
var unexpectedReactShallow = require('unexpected-react-shallow');

var expect = unexpected.clone()
     .installPlugin(unexpectedReactShallow);

```

# Assertions
 
## `to have rendered`

```js
expect(shallowRenderer, 'to have rendered', reactElement);
```

`reactElement` in this case is a ReactElement, normally created by using JSX

For example

```js
expect(shallowRenderer, 'to have rendered', <div className="test" />);
```

The same thing works for `shallowRenderer.getRenderOutput()`.

Extra props that are rendered are ignored (see `to have exactly rendered below`), as 
are extra children.

Using the following simple component:
```js

var Component = React.createClass({
     render: function () {
         return (
            <div className="parent" id="main">
                <span>one</span>
                <span className="middle">two</span>
                <span>three</span>
            </div>
         );
     }
});
```

You can make the following assertions:

```js
// Extra props and children from the render are ignored
expect(renderer, 'to have rendered', <div className="parent" />);

// The span "two" is missing here, but it is ignored.
expect(renderer, 'to have rendered',
   <div id="main">
      <span>one</span>
      <span>three</span>
  </div>
);

// The following assertion will fail, as 'four' does not exist
expect(renderer, 'to have rendered',
   <div id="main">
      <span>one</span>
      <span>four</span>
  </div>
);
```

If you want to check for an exact render, use `'to have exactly rendered'`


```js

// The span "two" is missing here, as is `className="parent"` 
// This will cause an assertion error, 
// due to `to have exactly rendered` being used

expect(renderer, 'to have exactly rendered',
   <div id="main">
      <span>one</span>
      <span>three</span>
  </div>
);
```

## `to contain`

It's possible to check for a part of the subtree, without 
testing the entire returned tree.  This allows you to test specific elements, without
writing brittle tests that break when the structure changes.

```js
// This will pass, as `<span className="middle">two</span>` can be found in the renderers output
expect(renderer, 'to contain', <span>two</span>);
```

Notice that the extra `className="middle"` in the `<span className="middle">two</span>` is ignored,
in a similar way to the `to have rendered` assertion. 

You can override this behaviour by using `'to contain exactly'`


```js
// This will fail, as `<span>two</span>` cannot be found in the renderers output, due to 
// the missing `className="middle"` prop
expect(renderer, 'to contain exactly', <span>two</span>);

```

The same thing applies to children for `'to contain'` as for `'to have rendered'`.

# Strings

String content is split up by React when you have embedded variables.

For example:

```js
{
    render: function() {
        return (
           <div>
              Click on {this.props.clickCount} times
           </div>
        );
    }
}
```

This actually produces 3 "child" elements of the div, `Click on `, the `clickCount` and the ` times`
To make this simpler, `unexpected-react-shallow` concatenates these values so you can simply test the 
previous example as follows:

```js
expect(renderer, 'to have rendered', 
    <div>
       Clicked on 3 times
    </div>);
```

If you use the `exactly` variants of the assertions, you will need to split up your assertion in the same way

e.g.
```js
expect(renderer, 'to have exactly rendered', 
    <div>
       Clicked on {3} times
    </div>);
```

# Contributing

We welcome pull requests, bug reports, and extra test cases. If you find something that doesn't work
as you believe it should, raise an issue!

# Thanks

Special thanks to all of the [unexpected](http://github.com/unexpectedjs) team. The quality failure 
messages and diffs have made a huge difference to the way I test, and how quickly issues are resolved.

A huge thanks to @Munter, who wrote [unexpected-dom](http://github.com/munter/unexpected-dom), which enables
testing DOM elements easily - it's perfect for more involved tests if you're using React and something
like [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).  A lot (most!) of the code for `unexpected-react-shallow` was
taken from `unexpected-dom`.
